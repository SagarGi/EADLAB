## **Source Code Management**
A Source Code Management (SCM) is a software tool used by programmers to manage the source codes.
SCMs are used to give versions/revisions to the program. Each version is given a timestamp and include the person responsible for the change. Even various versions can be compared and merged with other versions. This is why SCM is also referred to Version Control, Revision Control or Source Control.

## **Types of Version Vontrol System**
There are two main types of version control system.

### 1. Centralized Version Control System
The main concept of Centralized Version Control is that it works in a client and server relationship. The repository is located in one place and allows access to multiple clientsItâ€™s very similar to FTP where you have FTP clients which connect to FTP server. Here all the user changes and commits have to pass through the central server. 

### 2. Distributed Version Control System
These systems are newer to use. In Distributed Version Control, each user has their own copy of the entire repository as well as the files and history. For Ex: Git and Mercurial

#### **Git as a Source Code Management**
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.s
