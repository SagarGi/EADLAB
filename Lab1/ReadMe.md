## **Source Code Management**
###### A Source Code Management (SCM) is a software tool used by programmers to manage the source codes.
###### SCMs are used to give versions/revisions to the program. Each version is given a timestamp and includes ###### the person responsible for the change. Even various versions can be compared and merged with other versions. This is why SCM is also referred to Version Control, Revision Control or Source Control.
